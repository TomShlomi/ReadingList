# ReadingList

Allows more interaction with Google Chrome's Reading List feature. To use, go to https://takeout.google.com/ and choose ReadingList (it will be under Chrome). 
Clone this repository, move ReadingList.html into it, and run "./readinglist.sh init". Repeat this process whenever you want to synchronize your reading list.

Once initialized, you can run "./readinglist.sh random" to open a random URL from your reading list or "./readinglist.sh next" to open the alphabetically first URL.
